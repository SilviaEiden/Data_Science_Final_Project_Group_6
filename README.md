Module 20 - Data Science - Final Project

# Presentation
### Team Members:
- Liliia Strukova
- Silvia Eiden
- Hina Mahboob
- Maureen Hubka

### Selected topic: 
 - Travel Insurance Claims Dataset
 
### Reason: 
- The Travel Insurance Claims Dataset was chosen to investigate business opportunities to sell travel insurance in Singapore. We can investigate the pros and cons of investing in this type of business and gain insight into the market's trends.  We can use Machine Learning to gauge the accuaracy of the dataset to see if it can be used to develop a business model plan. 

### Description of the Data:

The Travel Insurance Dataset is from a third-party travel insurance servicing company that is based in Singapore. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle website.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhdzahier/travel-insurance

The following attributes are contained in the datset:
-  Target: Claim Status (Claim.Status)
- Name of agency (Agency)
- Type of travel insurance agencies (Agency.Type)
- Distribution channel of travel insurance agencies (Distribution.Channel)
- Name of the travel insurance products (Product.Name)
- Duration of travel (Duration)
- Destination of travel (Destination)
- Amount of sales of travel insurance policies (Net.Sales)
- Commission received for travel insurance agency (Commission)
- Gender of insured (Gender)
- Age of insured (Age)

### Questions we hope to answer:

- Is there a relationship between travel destination and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship between type of travel insurance agencies and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship between duration of travel of travel insurance agencies and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship betwee age of insured and insurance claims?
- Can these data points be used to accurately predict insurance claims?
- Does type of sales affect claims or amount of insurance sold or claims?
- Are there any other trends that could be used to determine the likelihood of insurance claims being filed?

Answers to these questions can be used to determine sales stategies for areas that are lacking, risky areas to sell travel inusrance and if the business is a worthwhile investment. 


## Git Hub

A Git Hub Main Branch was created with four branches for team members to contribute to based on the portion of the project being worked on.  The following brances were created and each team member was to have at least four commits from the duration of the first segment.


### Description of the communication protocols:

Communication venues were set up for the team via Slack, Group text, and Zoom meetings. Team members were assigned weekly roles and each member committed the resuls of their tasks to Git Hub.

Individual Branches 
- At least one branch for each team 
member 
- Each team member has at least four 
commits from the duration of the first 
segment 
Note: The descriptions and 
explanations required in all other 
project deliverables should also be in 
your README.md as part of your 
outline, unless otherwise noted.

## Machine Learning Model

Team members present a provisional 
machine learning model that stands in 
for the final machine learning model 
and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional 
database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database
Team members present a provisional 
database that stands in for the final 
database and accomplishes the 
following: 
- Sample data that mimics the 
expected final database structure or 
schema 
- Draft machine learning module is 
connected to the provisional databas
