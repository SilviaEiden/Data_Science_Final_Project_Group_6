# Data Science Final Project Group 6

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our skills developed over our six month data visualization bootcamp.

## Presentation
### Team Members:

### Selected topic: 
Travel insurance claims. 
 
### Reason: 
The travel insurance claims dataset was chosen to investigate business opportunities to sell travel insurance. We can investigate the pros and cons of investing in this type of business and gain insight into the market's trends.  We can use Machine Learning to gauge the accuracy of the dataset to see if it can be used to develop a business model plan. 

### Description of the Data:

The Travel Insurance Dataset is from a third-party travel insurance servicing company that is based in Singapore. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle website. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mhdzahier/travel-insurance

The following attributes are contained in the dataset:
- Target: Claim Status (Claim.Status)
- Name of agency (Agency)
- Type of travel insurance agencies (Agency.Type)
- Distribution channel of travel insurance agencies (Distribution.Channel)
- Name of the travel insurance products (Product.Name)
- Duration of travel (Duration)
- Destination of travel (Destination)
- Amount of sales of travel insurance policies (Net.Sales)
- Commission received for travel insurance agency (Commission)
- Gender of insured (Gender)
- Age of insured (Age)

### Questions we hope to answer:

- Is there a relationship between travel destination and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship between type of travel insurance agencies and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship between duration of travel and insurance claims?
- Is there a relationship between age of insured and insurance claims?
- Can these data points be used to accurately predict insurance claims?
- Does type of sales (i.e.: online, product) affect claims or the amount of insurance sold?
- Are there any other trends that could be used to determine the likelihood of insurance claims being filed?

Answers to these questions can be used to determine sales strategies for areas that are lacking, risky areas to sell travel insurance and if the business is a worthwhile investment. 


## GitHub

A GitHub Main Branch was created with four branches for team members to contribute to, based on the portion of the project being worked on.  The following branches were created and each team member was to have at least four commits from the duration of the first segment.

### Description of the communication protocols:

Communication venues were set up for the team via Slack, Group text, and Zoom meetings. Team members were assigned weekly roles and each member committed the results of their tasks to Git Hub.

## Machine Learning Model

Team members present a provisional 
machine learning model that stands in 
for the final machine learning model 
and accomplishes the following:
- Takes in data in from the provisional 
database
- Outputs label(s) for input data

## Database

The Travel Insurance Claims Dataset csv file was downloaded from Kaggle. It was visually analyzed to determine what fields would be most useful. It was then pulled into PGADMIN. SQL code was used in query tool to successfully create tables. 



## Dashboard
Tableau will be used as a data visual dashboard for the project. Microsoft Power Point slides will be used for the demo presentation.
